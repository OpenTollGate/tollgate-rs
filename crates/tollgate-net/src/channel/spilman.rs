//! Real Cashu Spilman channels, funded against a real mint.
//!
//! This is the backend that puts value at stake. A channel is a 2-of-2 multisig
//! Cashu token; a ratchet turn is a signed balance update the receiver can take
//! to the mint; settlement is a swap.
//!
//! # No prices here
//!
//! The receiver is configured with a pricing entry that **prices nothing**, so
//! the Spilman layer's "amount due" is always zero and it enforces only the
//! ratchet and the signature. That is deliberate and it is the whole fit: delivery has no price
//! ([`tollgate-vouchers.md`]), and what a peer may draw is decided by
//! `tollgate-core`'s admission control against the grant. The channel layer
//! carries the money; it does not decide how much is owed.
//!
//! # Where the vouchers come from
//!
//! A channel is funded in a mint the **peer** accepts, and the peer's own mint
//! is always reachable — it is the peer we are already talking to. So funding a
//! channel to pay a peer means first holding that peer's vouchers, and how a
//! peer came to hold vouchers is not the protocol's business, any more than how
//! it came to hold sats. Buying them is [`crate::market`]'s job, and this layer
//! only asks it for what a channel needs.
//!
