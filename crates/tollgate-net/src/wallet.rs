//! What this node is holding, and how it spends it.
//!
//! A thin layer over cdk's wallet, and deliberately nothing more. Proof
//! selection, change, keyset rotation, the spent-proof bookkeeping and the
//! database behind it are all Cashu problems that cdk has already solved; what
//! this adds is the part that is TollGate's — a node holds paper from several
//! issuers, and what it can do with a holding depends on who issued it.
//!
//! - **money** — sat-denominated tokens from a mint that deals in money. Any
//!   peer that accepts that mint will take them, so this is what a node pays
//!   with generally, and the only thing it can top itself up in.
//! - **prepaid transit** — byte-denominated tokens from an *upstream*: capacity
//!   bought and not yet spent. Also spending power, but only at the one node
//!   that issued them, since nobody else's mint honours them.
//!
//! What a node never accumulates is its own vouchers. A customer pays in the
//! paper this node issued, and redeeming that cancels this node's own claim —
//! the money side of being paid arrives as money, at the market, which is why
//! selling shows up in the first list and not the second.
//!
//! So one cdk wallet per (mint, unit), created on demand and kept in one
//! database. Balances are reported money first, because a node short of money
//! cannot buy from anyone, where a node short of one upstream's vouchers is
//! only short with that upstream.
//!
//! # Why the node holds anything at all
//!
//! It could buy money for each purchase and hold nothing. That is what it did
//! first, and it is wrong twice over: every channel it funds then waits on a
//! Lightning settlement — seconds, inside a rollover that has milliseconds —
//! and the money it *takes* has nowhere to go. A balance answers both. Buying
//! becomes local, and payment received is payment kept.
