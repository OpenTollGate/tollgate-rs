//! The resource adapter: what actually delivers, and what counts it.
//!
//! Core decides *what* to enforce; an adapter enforces it. For network
//! forwarding that means two numbers per peer — an **access level** and a
//! **shaping rate** — and two counters.
//!
//! Both are per peer, and they are orthogonal. A grant buys a rate, so a binary
//! gate cannot express what was sold; and an unpaid peer is not simply blocked,
//! because the minimum flow allowance is itself a rate. Every peer therefore
//! carries both at all times.
//!
//! Two implementations:
//!
//! - [`Loopback`] shapes and meters a dedicated socket in userspace. It
//!   forwards nobody's traffic, but the shaping and the counters are real, so it
//!   exercises the whole protocol on any platform.
//! - [`Nftables`] gates and shapes the kernel's own forwarding path with
//!   nftables and `tc`. This is the one that carries somebody else's packets,
//!   and it needs Linux and `CAP_NET_ADMIN`.
