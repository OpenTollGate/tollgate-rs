//! Gating and shaping the kernel's own forwarding path.
//!
//! This is the adapter that carries somebody else's packets. Two mechanisms,
//! because access and rate are different questions:
//!
//! - **nftables** decides *whether* a packet is forwarded, and counts what was.
//!   Membership of a named set is the gate, so changing a peer's access is one
//!   set element rather than a rule rewrite.
//! - **`tc`** decides *how fast*. One HTB class per peer, whose rate is
//!   replaced as grants arrive.
//!
//! Both are driven by shelling out to `nft` and `tc`. That is deliberate: the
//! netlink crates would pull a large dependency and a lot of unsafe for
//! something invoked a handful of times per peer per second, and `nft -j`
//! already speaks JSON.
//!
//! # What is shaped, and what is not
//!
//! Only the peer's **download** — bytes we forward toward it. Its upload is
//! charged through the `received_multiplier`, which drains that peer's own
//! grant faster rather than capping its ingress, so a peer that pushes harder
//! exhausts its grant sooner and falls to the allowance. No ingress policer is
//! involved, and that is a design choice rather than an omission.
//!
//! And only traffic we **forward**, never traffic that terminates here. The
//! distinction is load-bearing rather than tidy. A peer whose grant has lapsed
//! falls to the minimum flow allowance, and the whole point of that allowance is
//! to leave it able to reach us and buy its way back up. Shaping by destination
//! address would put the control plane and the mint in the same class as the
//! bulk transit that just exhausted the grant, so a peer saturating its link
//! would starve the very messages that would have renewed it — a deadlock that
//! ends with the session dropped as stale.
//!
//! So the forward hook marks what it forwards and `tc` classifies on that mark.
//! Locally generated traffic never traverses that hook, is never marked, and
//! falls through to the qdisc's default: unshaped.
//!
//! # Requirements
//!
//! Linux, `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, and `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`. Without the capability
//! every command fails and the node would gate nothing while believing it had,
//! so construction probes for it and refuses to start rather than pretending.
