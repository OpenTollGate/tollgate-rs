//! Gating and shaping a FIPS mesh, through its control socket.
//!
//! FIPS carries the traffic and enforces the policy; this sets the policy. Two
//! commands do the work — `set_transit_policy` says whether a peer's traffic is
//! carried and how fast, and `show_transit_policy` reports what has moved under
//! it — so nothing here has to know how a mesh forwards anything.
//!
//! # Why this one is safe where the kernel adapter is not
//!
//! [`Nftables`](super::Nftables) binds a peer's public key to whatever address
//! it announced itself from, on the peer's own say-so. On an unwrapped IP
//! network that is a real hole: claim a paying peer's key and its grant gates
//! your address.
//!
//! FIPS names peers by npub and has already authenticated the link with a Noise
//! IK handshake before this node hears about it, so a policy set here lands on
//! the key that actually completed that handshake. There is no address to spoof
//! and no binding step to subvert — which is why the [`register`] address
//! argument is ignored rather than merely unused.
//!
//! [`register`]: ResourceAdapter::register

//! A peer is addressed by npub and reported by node address, both derived from
//! its TollGate key in [`crate::fips`] rather than asked for.
