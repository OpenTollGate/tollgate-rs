//! This node's own mint.
//!
//! Every node issues vouchers against its own capacity and redeems them on
//! delivery. Redemption is a local spent-proof check — the node is the
//! authority on its own paper — which is why payment liveness and service
//! liveness fail together rather than separately.
//!
//! The keyset unit is the **byte**, not the sat. That is one of the three
//! things the voucher model changes, and it is what makes a proof a claim on
//! one unit of capacity rather than on money. A `1024` proof is a 1 KiB claim;
//! two of them make 2 KiB; they split and combine like any other Cashu token.
//!
//! # No Lightning here
//!
//! This mint has no payment processor at all, which is deliberate rather than
//! unfinished. Bolt11 is denominated in msat and this keyset is denominated in
//! bytes, so a mint quote would have to invent an exchange rate; and a peer
//! that wants to pay in money already has a way to hold money — somebody
//! else's sat-denominated mint. So the only way capacity is sold is through
//! [`crate::market`], which takes that paper and signs against it.
//!
//! Everything the mint itself does is real: the keysets, the blind signatures,
//! the DLEQ proofs and the spent-proof set.
