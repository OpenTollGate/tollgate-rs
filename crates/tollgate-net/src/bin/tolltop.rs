//! A live view of what a TollGate node is doing.
//!
//! Reads the node's control socket and redraws. Three tabs, because the node
//! does three separable things: it carries traffic for peers, it sells the
//! vouchers that pay for it, and it holds what it is paid.
//!
//! The peers tab is deliberately organised around the thing the protocol makes
//! hard to see: **two independent payment streams per peer**. What a peer
//! bought from us and what we bought from it are different channels, different
//! mints, different windows, bought at different moments — so they get separate
//! columns rather than one netted number, because netting them would invent a
//! relationship the protocol does not have. A row is a summary; Enter opens
//! everything the node knows about that peering.
//!
//! The pricing tab is where an operator changes what the node charges. The
//! price is the one setting worth moving while a node runs — an uplink becomes
//! scarce, or stops being — and moving it touches no session, grant or channel:
//! it decides what the *next* buyer of vouchers pays, and nothing already sold.
//!
//! The wallet tab is where the money is, and the only place the display asks
//! anything of the outside world: topping up produces an invoice somebody has
//! to pay, so it is shown as a QR as well as a string. The thing paying it is
//! usually a phone.
