//! The data plane: the resource itself.
//!
//! A separate socket from the control plane, carrying the bytes that are being
//! bought and sold. Nothing here speaks TollGate — it is the traffic, not the
//! protocol, and it exists so the demo shapes and meters **real** bytes rather
//! than a number in a spreadsheet.
//!
//! Each side writes to the other at whatever its shaper currently permits, and
//! counts what it writes as delivered and what it reads as received. Those are
//! the same two counters core draws grants down against, so the loop closes:
//! demand drives a purchase, the purchase raises the shaping rate, the shaper
//! releases more bytes, and the throughput the operator sees follows.
//!
//! In a real deployment this is replaced by nftables and a TUN device, or by a
//! FIPS delivery filter. The layers above it do not change.
