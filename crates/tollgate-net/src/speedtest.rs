//! A byte source and sink, so a client can measure what it actually gets.
//!
//! **Not part of the TollGate protocol.** Nothing here is exchanged between
//! nodes, nothing is signed, and a node that serves none of it works exactly as
//! well. It is an operator's instrument, and the audience is a person with a
//! browser.
//!
//! # Why a node has to serve the bytes itself
//!
//! The obvious way to build a speed test is the way Fast.com does it: point the
//! client at a CDN and time the download. That measures the path from the
//! client to Netflix, which is nearly all the path this node does not control
//! and cannot sell. Worse, it measures it *through* the tollgate, so the number
//! moves for reasons — a congested upstream, a slow peering point — that have
//! nothing to do with what was bought.
//!
//! Serving the bytes from the node itself turns that around. The client pulls
//! from an address on the mesh, so the flow crosses exactly the hops that were
//! paid for and nothing else. Under `forwarding.mode: fips` that is also the
//! honest number in the other direction: FIPS is enforcing the transit policy
//! this node set for that peer, so what the page reads is the grant in force,
//! not an unshaped side channel around it.
//!
//! # What the measurement window is for
//!
//! A fresh flow over the mesh is slow twice over — TCP slow start, and a Noise
//! handshake before that — and a grant bought a moment ago may not be in force
//! for the first packets. Averaging from the first byte reports the ramp. So
//! the page discards a warm-up window and reports only what came after it, and
//! it opens several flows at once, because one TCP flow over an encrypted mesh
//! at a 1472-byte MTU will under-read a link that has more to give.
//!
//! # This is not free capacity
//!
//! The endpoints are unauthenticated: anything that can reach the listener can
//! pull bytes from it. On a node in `fips` mode that is the intended shape,
//! because the transit those bytes cross is already gated by what the peer
//! bought — the test consumes a client's own allowance rather than bypassing
//! it. On a node in any other mode it is a free firehose, which is why it is
//! off unless an operator turns it on, and why one request is capped.
