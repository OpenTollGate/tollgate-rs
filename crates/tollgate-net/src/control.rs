//! What the node will tell a local tool about itself, and the one thing it
//! will take instructions about.
//!
//! A Unix socket serving a JSON snapshot, one per connection. The node
//! republishes the snapshot on every tick and the socket hands out whatever is
//! current, so a reader never blocks the event loop and the loop never waits on
//! a reader.
//!
//! A caller that says nothing gets the snapshot, which is what every reader
//! did before there was anything to say. A caller that sends a line of JSON
//! first gets an answer to it instead — see [`Request`]. The only thing that
//! can be changed this way is the market price: it is the one number an
//! operator has a reason to move while the node runs, and moving it does not
//! touch a session, a grant or a channel.
//!
//! Local-only by construction: a Unix socket has no port to expose, and
//! nothing here is reachable by a peer.
