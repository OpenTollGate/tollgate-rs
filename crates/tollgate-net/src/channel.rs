//! Payment channels, behind a trait.
//!
//! Channels exist to keep the issuer's spent-proof set bounded, not to prevent
//! theft: when the provider is the mint for its own vouchers, the only party
//! who could cheat is also the party who would have to honor the refund. What
//! bounds that is exposure and reputation, not cryptography. Without channels
//! the spent-proof set is roughly 700× larger, which ends a session within
//! hours on hardware with 16–128 MB of flash.
//!
//! The trait is where a real Cashu Spilman implementation plugs in. It is
//! deliberately synchronous: the reference implementation's own in-memory mint
//! path is synchronous too, and the node drives every call through
//! `spawn_blocking`, feeding the result back as an [`Event`] — which is exactly
//! the seam core's action/event split exists to provide.
//!
//! [`Event`]: tollgate_core::Event
