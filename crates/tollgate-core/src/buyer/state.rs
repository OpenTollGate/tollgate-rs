//! What this node has bought from one peer, and the policy it buys under.
//!
//! The Spilman ratchet is **per channel** — a cumulative total only means
//! anything against the channel it was signed on — so the payer tracks up to
//! three at once:
//!
//! ```text
//! active    being drained now
//! next      funded and confirmed, waiting for `active` to fill
//! pending   funded by us, not yet confirmed by the peer
//! ```
//!
//! A channel is opened well before it is needed (default: at 80% of the one in
//! use) precisely so that `next` is ready by the time a purchase overflows
//! `active`, and the overflow can be signed across both rather than stalling.
