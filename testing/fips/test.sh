# Selling transit over a FIPS mesh, end to end.
#
# The same claim as the nftables forwarding topology — the rate a peer buys is
# the rate it gets, measured by pulling a real file — but with the enforcement
# on the other side of a control socket, in a daemon that routes and encrypts
# rather than in the local kernel. Two things this topology can assert that the
# IP one cannot:
#
#   - the peer that gets the grant is the peer that holds the key, because the
#     control plane checks an announced key against the mesh address it came
#     from rather than believing it;
#   - the payment path is not the shaped path as a matter of protocol, not of
#     interface layout: a message addressed to the gateway is never transit.
